# Lakevision

Lakevision is a tool that provides insights into your Data Lakehouse based on the **Apache Iceberg** table format.

It lists every namespace and table in your Lakehouse‚Äîalong with each table‚Äôs schema, properties, snapshots, partitions, sort-orders, references/tags, and sample data‚Äîand supports nested namespaces. This helps you quickly understand data layout, file locations, and change history.

Lakevision is built with **pyiceberg**, a `FastAPI` backend, and a `SvelteKit` frontend, keeping other dependencies to a minimum.

## Features

* Search and view all namespaces in your Lakehouse
* Search and view all tables in your Lakehouse
* Display schema, properties, partition specs, and a summary of each table
* Show record count, file count, and size per partition
* List all snapshots with details
* Graphical summary of record additions over time
* OIDC/OAuth-based authentication support
* Pluggable authorization
* Optional ‚ÄúChat with Lakehouse‚Äù capability

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Before running Lakevision, you'll need to create and configure your local `.env` file:

```bash
cp my.env .env
```

Then edit .env to provide values for:

- Your Iceberg catalog configuration (URI, warehouse path, etc.)
  
  üß™ Don‚Äôt have a catalog yet? You can start with a sample one. See make [`make sample-catalog`](#with-makefile-recommended) in the Makefile section.

- Authentication details (e.g., token or credentials)
- Optional cloud settings (S3, GCP, etc.)

This avoids modifying `my.env`, which is version-controlled and serves as a template.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest way to run Lakevision is with Docker.

1. **Clone the repository** and `cd` into the project root.

2. **Build the image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t lakevision:1.0 .
   ```

3. **Run the container**

   Make sure you‚Äôve completed the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) step first.

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env -p 8081:8081 lakevision:1.0 /app/start.sh
   ```

Once started, the backend listens on port 8000 and Nginx runs on port 8081. Visit [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to explore the UI.

> ‚úÖ Tested on Linux and macOS with the Iceberg REST catalog. Other PyIceberg-compatible catalogs should work too.

<details>
<summary><strong>üß™ Want to try the in-memory sample catalog?</strong></summary>

To build the image with the sample in-memory Iceberg catalog included:

```bash
docker build --build-arg ENABLE_SAMPLE_CATALOG=true -t lakevision:1.0 .
```

- In your `.env`, comment out the default catalog settings and uncomment the sample catalog lines.
- Then run the container as above

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally (Terminal or VS Code)

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js 18+
* A running Iceberg catalog

### üîÄ With Makefile (recommended)

Make sure you‚Äôve completed the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) step first.

You can use the Makefile to automate common setup steps:

```bash
make init-be           # Set up Python backend
make sample-catalog    # Populate a local Iceberg catalog with sample data
make init-fe           # Install frontend dependencies
make run-be            # Start backend (FastAPI)
make run-fe            # Start frontend (SvelteKit)
make help              # List all Makefile commands
```

Once running, visit [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to use the app.

### üîß Manual Setup (for advanced use)

#### 1. Configure environment

Make sure you‚Äôve completed the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) step first.

> üí° **Frontend note:**
> All environment variables that begin with `PUBLIC_` must be available in a separate `.env` file inside the `/fe` folder.
> You can do this manually, or by running:

```bash
make prepare-fe-env
```

This ensures the frontend build system (Vite) can access the variables during development.

#### 2. Backend

```bash
cd be
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
set -a; source ../.env; set +a
PYTHONPATH=app uvicorn app.api:app --reload --port 8000
```

#### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd ../fe
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 8081
```


## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment

Want to deploy Lakevision on Kubernetes or OpenShift?  
Sample manifests are provided in [`k8s/`](k8s/), including example `Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, and `Secret` YAMLs for running the unified (backend + frontend) container.

- See [`k8s/README.md`](k8s/README.md) for quickstart instructions and customization notes.
- You‚Äôll need to edit the image name and environment variables before deploying.


## üß≠ Roadmap

* Chat with Lakehouse capability using an LLM
* Table-level reports (most snapshots, partitions, columns, size, etc.)
* Optimization recommendations
* Limited SQL capabilities ‚úÖ
* Partition details (name, file count, records, size) ‚úÖ
* Sample data by partition ‚úÖ
* Table-level insights
* Time-travel queries

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Create** a branch for your change, referencing an issue if one exists.
3. **Add tests** for new functionality where appropriate.
4. **Open a pull request** with a clear description of the changes.
